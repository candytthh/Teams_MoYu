# keep teams online 

This reqpo intends to store codes of regular operation of Windows bla bla to keep your teams status online.

The best solution is to run keyboard_optimization.py which would create a txt file to input sentence by simulation of typing keyboard, default time slot is 2 hours.
To run the code, installing pyautogui is necessary. pls execute `pip install pyautogui` 

keyboard.py also works, but you need to open a txt file at first

mouse.py not good so far, since Teams would not be woked up sometimes.
